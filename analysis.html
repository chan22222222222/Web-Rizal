        <h3>Literary Significance</h3>
        <p>
          Rizal’s works introduced a new era of Filipino literature. By writing in
          both Spanish and native languages, he reached local and international
          audiences. His narratives deftly combined realism, symbolism, and satire,
          compelling readers to confront the realities of colonialism. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Rizal's vivid portrayal of social ills spurred intellectual discourse among
          the educated class, leading to deeper discussions about human rights and
          national sovereignty.

        <h3>Contemporary Relevance</h3>
        <p>
          Many issues Rizal addressed—such as corruption, social injustice, and the
          struggle for identity—persist today. His belief in the power of education
          and civic responsibility continues to resonate with modern advocates of
          reform.
        </p>
        <p>
          By examining the past, Rizal challenges current and future generations to
          break cycles of oppression and champion equality. His call for constructive
          dialogue and community involvement remains a blueprint for peaceful,
          transformative change.
