      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Jose Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</strong> (1861–1896) was a
        Filipino nationalist, polymath, writer, and revolutionary. Born in Calamba, Laguna,
        Rizal excelled in literature, medicine, and the arts. He is best known for his novels
        <em>Noli Me Tángere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>, which exposed social injustices
        under Spanish rule and ignited the Philippine nationalist movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rizal's advocacy for peaceful reform, education, and social equality continues to inspire
        generations. Even after his execution by the Spanish in 1896, his life and writings have
        come to symbolize the struggle for Philippine independence and the enduring quest for justice.

      <h2>Family and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Born into a well-respected family with deep cultural roots, Rizal was the seventh of eleven
        children. His parents, <strong>Francisco Mercado</strong> and <strong>Teodora Alonso Realonda</strong>,
        instilled in him a profound sense of discipline, education, and patriotism. His upbringing in Calamba
        was marked by an environment that celebrated learning and civic responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among his siblings, his older brother <strong>Paciano</strong> was a trusted confidant and early mentor,
        whose involvement in reformist activities helped shape Rizal's revolutionary ideals. His other siblings,
        including Saturnina, Narcisa, Olympia, Lucia, Maria, Josefa, Trinidad, and Soledad, also played vital roles
        in supporting his vision and the broader movement for Filipino self-determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Rizal family, through both their sacrifices and contributions, became emblematic of the struggle for
        national identity and freedom. Their legacy endures as a testament to the power of education, resilience,
        and a deep-rooted love for country.

      <h2>Contributions and Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        Rizal was not only a brilliant writer but also an avid scholar and visionary. Educated in Manila and later
        in Europe, he mastered multiple languages and absorbed the progressive ideas of his time. His academic
        pursuits in medicine and the arts were complemented by his active engagement with liberal thinkers,
        which greatly influenced his ideas on reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        His works, particularly his novels, combined literary artistry with sharp social commentary, offering a
        profound critique of colonial injustice. Rizal's writings, along with his essays and letters, played a crucial
        role in mobilizing the Philippine reform movement and sowing the seeds for the eventual revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even decades after his martyrdom, Rizal's ideas continue to resonate. His advocacy for education, human rights,
        and national pride remains influential in shaping modern Filipino identity, and his legacy endures as a beacon
        of hope and resilience for people across the nation.
