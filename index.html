      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Jose Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</strong> (1861–1896) was a
        Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary. Born in Calamba, Laguna, Rizal
        excelled in multiple fields, from literature and medicine to the arts. He is
        best known for his novels <em>Noli Me Tángere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>,
        which exposed social injustices under Spanish rule and galvanized the
        Philippine nationalist movement. His writings advocated for peaceful reform,
        education, and equality, ultimately inspiring a generation of Filipinos to
        strive for independence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Executed by the Spanish in 1896, Rizal became a martyr whose life and works
        continue to influence the Philippines’ pursuit of self-determination and
        national identity. His essay <em>The Philippines a Century Hence</em> remains a
        cornerstone of Filipino political thought, anticipating both the trials and
        triumphs the nation would face on its path to freedom.
